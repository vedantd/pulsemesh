## 2026-11-07 — H1c least-privilege CI policy regression guard (PR pending)

- **Starting point:** inspected current main CI, H1a/#70 and H1b/#72 logged merges, open H1/#65, H2/#66 and independent-host/#67, and open H2 PR #74. Avoided overlapping H2.
- **ADR-H1c-001:** protect reviewed CI invariants with a narrow source-text policy test rather than introducing a new YAML dependency; reject privileged PR triggers, write token permissions, mutable action revisions, unlocked install, missing lock verification, or missing public release-block assertions. Test does not replace GitHub branch protection or human workflow review.
- **Implementation:** `src/ci-policy-check.mjs` and `tests/ci-policy-check.test.mjs`, with positive checked-in workflow and six negative mutation scenarios. Existing `npm test` includes tests automatically. No listener or real-data changes.
- **Verification:** full GitHub CI pending at time of commit. Do not merge until the entire workflow passes. CI policy regex is intentionally conservative and may reject legitimate future workflow changes until reviewed. Both release profiles remain blocked.

## 2026-11-07 — H1b-1 immutable CI and CycloneDX evidence merged

- **PR:** [#72](https://github.com/vedantd/palantinty-network/pull/72), merge commit `f6f76491ff65031230315d0ea094d67b62f26b85`.
- **CI:** [run 42374563925](https://github.com/vedantd/palantinty-network/actions/runs/42374563925), job `128409400059`: **success**, **184 tests passed / 0 failed**, release gate checker and P02c/M10 private-container integration passed.
- **Supply-chain artifact:** GitHub Actions artifact `h1b-node-locked-cyclonedx-sbom` (artifact ID `13575545881`), CycloneDX **1.5**, **131** dependency components, SHA-256 of raw JSON `81ac3524df6687b0d6bca21651a7b12aa0f1da0fa41e35af4d818c67d6abacab`. Artifact expires after 14 days; retention is not permanent immutable provenance.
- **CI action pinning:** Official immutable checkout v7.0.1, setup-node v7.1.0 and upload-artifact v7.0.2 SHA references with read-only PR token.
- **Status:** H01b remains **partial**. Docker base digest pinning, CVE and maintainer triage, signed release provenance/artifacts, rollback and external review remain outstanding. Official `release-supply-chain` gate is still blocked, as are all other public release gates. Follow [#65](https://github.com/vedantd/palantinty-network/issues/65).

## 2026-11-07 — H1b-1 immutable GitHub Actions and dependency SBOM (CI pending)

- **Starting point:** H1a lockfile npm ci merged (#70), H01a tracker verified, H1b #65 still release-blocking.
- **Research:** Official GitHub refs/releases for checkout v7.0.1, setup-node v7.1.0 and upload-artifact v7.0.2 inspected on 2026-11-07; action execution moves to Node 24 runtimes but project remains Node 22.
- **Decision ADR-H1b-1:** Use immutable 40-hex action revisions and read-only PR token, produce CycloneDX SBOM from locked dependencies, retain for 14 days as evidence only.
- **Implementation:** CI SHA pins, `npm sbom` and immutable artifact upload, regression tests, [H1B_CI_PROVENANCE.md](H1B_CI_PROVENANCE.md).
- **CI:** Pending until actual full GitHub Actions run completes. No gate unblocked.
- **Residual:** Docker image digest pinning, dependency audit triage, verifiable signed/tagged release, independent reviewer and all non-supply-chain gates remain open.

## 2026-11-07 — H1a lockfile and CI verification merged

- **PR:** [#70](https://github.com/vedantd/palantinty-network/pull/70), merged to main at `94fbddc0243831c4cc14174f7f5da0f0d37da689` from `c091096357c33457565926968ce0e6d3148743fa`.
- **CI:** [run 42373905601](https://github.com/vedantd/palantinty-network/actions/runs/42373905601) **success** — `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, `build:lock-check`, `release:plan-check`, **182 tests passed / 0 failed**, both blocked release profiles, P02c private bridge and M10 two-run persistent indexer integration.
- **Provenance:** `package-lock.json` SHA256 `1480492b81aeed9167a605b9c738392c384eb9cf8b7622b674deb516a8feed12`, 131 npm SHA512 tarball integrity records. Temporary trusted branch-only lock bootstrap and uploader removed before merge; `contents: read` remains the normal CI permission.
- **Scope:** H01a complete. H01b **not complete** (immutable action/image digests, SBOM, advisory triage, reproducible release artifacts, signatures). Official `release-supply-chain` and other public gates stay blocked. Next H01b or H02a based on independent review.

## 2026-11-07 — H1a deterministic npm lockfile (draft PR #70, CI pending)

- **Issue:** #65; previously CI/Docker used floating `npm install`.
- **Provenance:** Generated lockfile using trusted Node 22 GitHub runner, artifact in run 42373300374. SHA-256 `1480492b81aeed9167a605b9c738392c384eb9cf8b7622b674deb516a8feed12`, npm lock v3, 131 sha512-integrity tarballs from `registry.npmjs.org`. One-time trusted branch-only bootstrap run 42373521028 committed identical SHA; temporary write-scoped workflow removed before merging.
- **Decision ADR-H1a-001:** Require committed manifest-lock and `npm ci --ignore-scripts` in CI and both synthetic private containers; validate root dependency match, registry provenance and integrity. Ignore install-time package scripts unless a future security review explicitly authorizes them.
- **Tests:** New positive/negative `dependency-lock-check.test.mjs`, `build:lock-check` CI step, full GitHub Actions and Docker pending. Do not merge if red.
- **Limitations:** Mutable GitHub Actions/Docker tags, SBOM/signing/vulnerability triage remain H1b; 6+7 release gates blocked. No real sensor or public network activation.

## 2026-11-07 — Release-scope execution plan and safety-gated tracker (CI pending)

- **Starting point:** H0 private operator trust PR #64 merged; public release profiles remain blocked, and H1/#65, H2/#66, independent hosts/#67 are open.
- **Decision ADR-PLAN-001:** Plan all 28 slices through two **separate** release profiles, with machine-readable dependency DAG and an explicit 6-gate synthetic and 7-gate real-sensing mapping. Do not imply eight hours of scheduled sessions can replace independent physical/legal/privacy evidence.
- **Deliverable:** [PUBLIC_RELEASE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](PUBLIC_RELEASE_EXECUTION_PLAN.md), `config/release-execution-tracker.json`, `src/release-execution-tracker.mjs`, CLI and negative tests, CI gate. CI and merge state to be appended after verification.
- **Next:** H01a committed dependency lockfile and `npm ci` (#65), then H2 and private indexer/storage work if blocked. User authorized hourly work through afternoon; each run should inspect current main/CI to avoid overlap.
- **Safety:** Untrusted Internet listener and real BLE network publishing remain off; release gates remain blocked regardless of coding progress.

## 2026-11-07 — H0 runtime trust hardening verified and merged

- **PR:** [#64](https://github.com/vedantd/palantinty-network/pull/64) merged to `main` as `a42b9ab23406d2c34d34f70f3d445eb258f60ab9` from approved head `454c59ea014b507143826cad5deb819af2b2690e`.
- **CI:** [GitHub Actions run 42371653555](https://github.com/vedantd/palantinty-network/actions/runs/42371653555), job `128400851018`, completed **success** with **175 tests passed / 0 failed**, both release-gate assertions, network demonstrations and isolated private-container integration. An earlier failed run exposed a test-output timing race, which was fixed before the verified merge.
- **Behavior:** The standalone P02c operator pilot now refuses unknown, candidate, revoked and drifted private pins at preflight/start. A local watchdog detects enrollment revision/config changes and best-effort closes active libp2p connections. Tests cover live observer revocation.
- **CI security hygiene:** Workflow token explicitly restricted to read-only `contents: read`; job timeout bounded. No public network listener or real-data pipeline enabled.
- **Open blocking work:** [H1 supply chain #65](https://github.com/vedantd/palantinty-network/issues/65), [H2 revocation races #66](https://github.com/vedantd/palantinty-network/issues/66), [P02c physical hosts #67](https://github.com/vedantd/palantinty-network/issues/67). These are not resolved by this merge.
- **Release safety:** Both public synthetic and public real-sensing gate profiles remain blocked; the private pilot is not evidence of community joinability.

## 2026-11-07 — H0 targeted hardening review and private runtime trust guard

- **Audit:** Inspected P02c operator runtime, P03a approval ledger, P03b staging, P03c audit, P03d inspection, private file handling, CI build inputs, README/JOIN links and public release gates. Findings and severity are in [HARDENING_AUDIT_2026_11_07.md](HARDENING_AUDIT_2026_11_07.md).
- **Decision ADR-H0-001:** A P03 approval ledger must not remain purely advisory for the operator-run private pilot; startup must refuse unapproved pins, and a running node must stop on observed revocation or unexpected local approval/config revision changes. Keep all network listeners private and synthetic-only.
- **Implementation:** `src/p03-runtime-trust-guard.mjs` and integration into `apps/p02c-host-pilot.mjs`; migration of existing P02c test fixtures to explicit local approved enrollments; new live-node revocation tests; update runbooks and canonical links.
- **Tradeoff:** Tightens local operator state, but polls files rather than offering atomic revocation. An unresponsive process, compromised host, or race within the poll window still requires OS firewall/process containment; no public peers or real sensor inputs are activated.
- **Verification:** PR CI pending at authoring; final GitHub Actions and merge evidence should be recorded after successful full suite. Do not claim release-gate clearance from green CI.
- **Unresolved:** No committed npm lockfile/\`npm ci\` (H-002), no independent two-physical-host trial (H-003), TOCTOU/revocation boundary (H-004), geographic indexer lookup (H-008), indexer disaster recovery, real-sensing rights/privacy. See [EXECUTION_ROADMAP_NEXT.md](EXECUTION_ROADMAP_NEXT.md).
- **Next:** H1 reproducible dependency/build supply chain, then transactional private revocation and independently validated hosts; proceed to D01 private signed regional indexer directory only after core safety issues are understood.

## 2026-11-07 — P03d verified CI and merge evidence

- **PR:** #62 P03d offline startup-readiness inspection, head `6730263e17109b19439202fd93de18e22b0685bf`, squash merged to `main` as `49078b9e8ca6f3eec4df493812e11b7706db7e5c` after successful checks.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions `test` run [42357868052](https://github.com/vedantd/palantinty-network/actions/runs/42357868052), completed **success**; `node-tests` job `128359811468` passed `npm test`, synthetic demos, private-container checks and the public-release-gates assertion. CI is not independent physical-host evidence.
- **Decision:** Preserve ADR-P03d-001 as read-only, operator-reviewed inspection. No runtime authorization, live trust mutation or public admission. Next slice should consider an independently tested private discovery mechanism without widening listeners or trust.
- **Outstanding:** Snapshot TOCTOU and revocation race, runtime not integrated, no independently administered physical-host test, no real BLE ingestion, public release gates blocked.

## 2026-11-07 — P03d offline private startup-readiness inspection (CI pending)

- **Starting state:** `main` at `7524de1aed5388f9c55625191bd9443c53c4c2bf`; no open PRs. Inspected P03c audit, P03a ledger, P02c host config and emergency-stop operations, existing tests, project status and prior CI evidence.
- **Decision ADR-P03d-001:** Add read-only operator inspection, not a runtime authorization gate. See [P03D_OFFLINE_STARTUP_INSPECTION.md](P03D_OFFLINE_STARTUP_INSPECTION.md).
- **Implementation:** `src/p03-startup-inspection.mjs` validates private config and stop state, requires an existing distinct operator identity, audits exact approved remote pins and repeats reads to detect some concurrent drift.
- **Tests:** `tests/p03-startup-inspection.test.mjs` covers approved, unknown, candidate, revoked, stop-marker, missing config and missing local identity. **GitHub Actions pending; do not merge before green.**
- **Outstanding:** Repeated reads are not atomic and the runtime does not consume this inspection; manual restart may race with revocation. No independent physical-host evidence; public release gates blocked.

## 2026-11-07 — P03c CI and merge evidence

- **PR:** #60 merged into `main` after review of its read-only audit implementation and positive/negative tests. Source head `2d72cc58486aa89748f9df22413136639bf8a63e`; squash merge `0a1c63cd768c2434ab4452d1b1c16b528e3bde16`.
- **GitHub Actions:** workflow `test` run `42344860645` completed **success**; `node-tests` job `128320295455` passed `npm test`, synthetic network demos, private container checks, and the public-release-gates assertion. This is CI evidence, not an independent physical-host test.
- **Decision:** keep P03c an offline diagnostic only; no runtime enrollment or automatic trust update. Follow-up should address fail-closed operator-controlled startup reconciliation in a separate slice.
- **Outstanding:** no independent physical-host evidence, no public admission, no real BLE ingestion, and all public release gates remain blocked.

## 2026-11-07 — P03c offline pinned peer trust audit (PR pending CI)

- **Starting point:** main included merged P03b PR #59; no open PRs at inspection. Reviewed P03a ledger, P03b staging, P02c host-config validator, existing tests, status and execution ledger.
- **Decision ADR-P03c-001:** Implement read-only comparison of the active manually pinned config against the local approval ledger before any runtime trust automation. See [P03C_PRIVATE_TRUST_AUDIT.md](P03C_PRIVATE_TRUST_AUDIT.md).
- **Implementation:** `auditPrivatePilotPeer` reports unknown, candidate, revoked, IP drift and seed drift without modifying files or live peers.
- **Tests:** Positive approved-pin and negative unknown/candidate/revoked/seed drift/unsafe config cases added in `tests/p03-peer-audit.test.mjs`. CI outcome must be checked before merge.
- **Blockers:** A clean audit is a staleable local snapshot, not a startup authorization or independent peer verification. No independently operated physical-host evidence; all public release gates remain blocked.

## 2026-11-07 — P03b explicitly staged approved peer configuration

- **Starting point:** P03a (#58) green and merged. Ledger validates explicit candidate/approval/revocation but does not change running transport.
- **Decision ADR-P03b-001:** Require an operator-selected approved Peer ID and reviewed ledger revision, write a separate private config rather than dynamically changing libp2p trust.
- **Implementation:** `stagePrivatePilotPeer` checks exact revision, state, local identity, approved IP and address, private path, no overwrite, and refuses implicit LAN permission expansion. CLI stages one peer, reports `activated:false`.
- **Verification:** Tests cover candidate/revoked refusal, stale revision, no overwrite, path safety, localhost escalation, and preserving emergency-stop marker. Green CI required before merge.
- **Limitations:** No automatic application to a running node, no public registration, no independent physical-host acceptance. Operator must manually inspect, stop, review and restart.
- **Next:** P03c operator key transition/revocation reconciliation, then P03d private indexer directory with authenticated provider proof.

# Palantiny-network autonomous engineering ledger

Append new entries at the top as individual slices are completed. This file is an implementation log, **not** proof of security review or public deployment.

## 2026-11-07 — P03a local private peer enrollment

- **Starting point:** P02c-4 (#57) merged; synthetic localhost and private container tests pass; physical-host evidence and all P00 release gates remain blocked.
- **Research/inspection:** Reviewed `src/operator-provisioning.mjs`, `src/p02c-host-config.mjs`, `src/p02c-pilot-operations.mjs`, `src/synthetic-network-policy.mjs`, `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` and `docs/PUBLIC_PARTICIPATION_ROADMAP.md`. Existing enrollment is manually pinned, and revocation is a local stop marker; neither is public enrollment.
- **Decision ADR-P03a-001:** Establish a durable, explicit, local candidate → approved → revoked lifecycle before trying transport integration or network discovery. Approval requires out-of-band operator identity verification; no self-advertisement grants authority.
- **Implementation:** `src/p03-private-peer-ledger.mjs`, CLI, bounded file/entry validation, exclusive-writer lock and atomic on-disk revision tracking. Candidate-only state is not exported as trusted. Revoked Peer IDs are terminal.
- **Verification:** New negative/positive Node tests for state machine, bad remote addresses, seed mismatch, symlink/corrupt files, duplicate IDs and writer lock; full CI must pass before merging.
- **Explicit limitations:** This is **offline-only**; a running libp2p node still reads its separately provisioned pinned config. No multi-physical-host drill or public participation is claimed. Ledger is not a globally shared registry or anti-Sybil mechanism.
- **Next:** P03b explicit safe local pin activation and restart/rollback, then identity replacement and private indexer discovery. Leave public releases gated.

## Standing safeguards

Never copy operator keys into GitHub, open wildcard/public listeners, publish real BLE measurements, mark public release gates verified without reviewed independent evidence, or confuse signed records with trustworthy geographical/sensor provenance. Review per-slice CI and preserve decision records.
